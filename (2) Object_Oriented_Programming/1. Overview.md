# Overview of Object Oriented Programming in Python

Python adopts a traditional class-based approach to OOP which offers several advantages:

1. **Modular Design Promotion:** Python encourages the organization of code into modular structures which makes it easier to manage and understand.
2. **Software Reusability:** OOP in Python supports the reuse of code components which enhances code efficiency and maintainability.
3. **Real-World Modeling:** OOP in Python lets you model programs based on real-world objects which makes it intuitive and easy to design software.


Object-oriented programming promotes key principles such as data abstraction, information hiding, encapsulation and modular programming:

- **Data Abstraction:** OOP involves defining functions that operate on data which allows to abstract the data's behavior.
- **Information Hiding:** Data is encapsulated and can only be accessed or modified through interface functions which promotes information hiding. 
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation like information hiding ensures data protection by exposing it only through class methods. 
- **Inheritance:** Inheritance enables a class to inherit data members and methods from its parent class (base class).
- **Polymorphism:** Python achieves polymorphism through dynamic typing and late binding which allows a function to adapt to different interfaces depending on the caller's parameters.

In Python, a class defines a category of objects. It specifies the data it holds and the operations it supports through its interface functions. Each object created from a class is an instance of that class exhibiting the same behavior. A class contains object attributes (data members) and defines object behavior (methods) which can be inherited from other classes. These attributes and methods belong to the class's namespace.

## Class Instances

When dealing with class instances:

- **Identity:** Identifies objects by their unique memory location which can be determined using the `id()` function.
- **Object Type:** Specifies the internal representation of an object, determining its supported methods and operations. It can be determined using the `type()` function.

The attributes and methods of an object are accessed using a dot (.) notation.
